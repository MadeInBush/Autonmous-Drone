# Autonmous-Drone
code for an Autonmous drone, using mavros and C++

Given the GPS coordinates of the target location, this code will make the drone takeoff, orientate itself correctly, then fly autonmously to its target location. 

Currently the drone flys blind but am working on a avoidance system to be integrated into the code
